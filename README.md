# awesome-quantum-community
A meta list of quantum technology communities.

Quantum technology is a rapidly growing field with many different diciplines participating to make this tech a reality. This also means there is a wide variety of.

This is a curated list of up-to-date and active communities involved in the quantum technology space. there are other great awesome lists for [quantum computing](https://github.com/desireevl/awesome-quantum-computing#:~:text=Awesome%20Quantum%20Computing%20Quantum%20computing%20utilises%20quantum%20mechanical,as%20well%20as%20resources%20to%20learn%20about%20them.) and [quantum software](https://github.com/qosf/awesome-quantum-software) if you are looking for those types of resources.

> Sharing, suggestions and contributions are always welcome! Please take a look at the contribution guidelines and quality standard first. Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and it wouldn't be possible without you!
